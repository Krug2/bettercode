 * before any translation so a bug in the legacy bridge can no longer lose
 * what the provider said; the bridge runs behind the journal, on the way to
 * projections and the wire.
 *
 * `shape: "legacy"` is the older `{event_type, thread_id, payload}` shape. It
 * is written only by the frozen in-process provider stack
 * (`provider/adapters/`, `provider/service.ts`) and by the checkpoint
 * reactor's own emissions; it is not a target for new producers. Every row
 * written before this split is legacy-shaped, so the reader keeps this arm
 * for as long as those rows exist.
