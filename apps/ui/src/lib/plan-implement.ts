/**
 * Single source of truth for "implement this plan".
 *
 * Plan mode runs in interactive approval mode: when the agent proposes a plan
 * it opens a `plan_approval` request and parks the turn awaiting the user. The
 * correct way to implement is to RESOLVE that pending approval — the same turn
 * then continues into implementation. Dispatching a fresh "Implement the
 * proposed plan." chat turn instead collides with the still-active parked turn
 * (409 `turn_active`) and produced the duplicate messages + "chat send failed"
 * the user hit.
 *
 * So every Implement affordance funnels through here: if an approval is
 * pending → resolve it; only when none is pending (capture-style, a stale plan
 * from a prior session, or a brand-new thread) does the caller fall back to a
 * fresh implement message.
